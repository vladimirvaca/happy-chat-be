# Happy Chat

This is a project that uses the NestJS framework and WebSockets to create a chat application. 
It allows users **create accounts, login, create chat rooms, and send messages** to each other in real-time.

For this we use the following technologies:
- **NestJS**
- **Socket.IO** for real-time communication
- **PostgreSQL** as the database

## Project setup

```bash
 npm install
```

## Run the project

```bash
 # development
npm run start

 # watch mode
npm run start:dev

 # production mode
npm run start:prod
```
